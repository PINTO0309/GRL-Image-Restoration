## Introduction

**GRL** provides a mechanism to
efficiently and explicitly model image hierarchies in the
global, regional, and local range for image restoration. To
achieve that, we start by analyzing two important properties of natural images including cross-scale similarity
and anisotropic image features. Inspired by that, we propose the anchored stripe self-attention which achieves a
good balance between the space and time complexity of
self-attention and the modelling capacity beyond the regional range. Then we propose a new network architec-
ture dubbed GRL to explicitly model image hierarchies in
the Global, Regional, and Local range via anchored stripe
self-attention, window self-attention, and channel attention
enhanced convolution. Finally, the proposed network is applied to 7 image restoration types, covering both real and
synthetic settings. The proposed method sets the new state-of-the-art for several of those.

## How to Use the Code?

1. `conda create -n LightningIR python=3.8`
2. `conda activate LightningIR`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. prepare the dataset
5. download the pretrained models
6. ```bash
    torchx run -- -j 1x2 -- \
        -m training=False gpus=2 experiment=dm/grl model=grl/grl_small \
        load_state_dict=True pretrained_checkpoint="${MODEL_ZOO}/GRL/dm_grl_small.ckpt"
    ```
